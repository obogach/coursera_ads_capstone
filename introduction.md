## Gym Venue Optimal Location  

### Introduction
This project is about finding an optimal location for a gym. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a gym in Chicago, IL.  
There are a lot of sports facilities in Chicago, so the target is to detect optimal locations: accessible, not crowded with competitors, located closer to where people live, work or spend a lot of time, and proper adjacent tenants. More preferable locations will be identified among neighborhoods with higher income and greater population density.  
Data science power will be utilized to generate the top five most promising neighborhoods based on these criteria. The advantages of each location will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.

### Impact factors overview
The following factors impact our business problem:
* **Demographics of the neighborhood** - Normally, the majority of gym members prefer to have workouts at a nearby facility. This makes demographics an essential factor either to find optimal location or plan gym facilities. Population and Population density can be used to assess foot traffic as it mainly depends on how many people live in a particular neighborhood. Foot traffic is also important for a business to grow - walking by people can be converted to regular clients. Income and Population can also be used to help in decision making when choosing from multiple neighborhoods or exploring suitable quality, facility specialization, or membership options. The nearby location of the gym also promotes overall attendance. Such demographics factors as education, employment status, industries, occupation, sex and age can help better understand hidden correlations and therefore should also be explored.
* **Facility accessibility** - Location should be easily accessible by feet, bike, public transport or car. By feet is based on the closest location to such places as subway stations, public transport stops, shopping malls, or business centers. Clients who bike over to the gym facility will require additional area to secure it while on a workout. Such areas are often located nearby public commuting hubs, end of line transport stops or at car parking. Public transport in walking vicinity is also a significant factor, meaning clients can commute more faster and take a short walk to the gym. For clients driving a car, the nearby parking lot is a mandatory consideration.
* **Competitors** - The best strategy with competitors is to avoid or minimize their impact by distancing from them. Competitors are not only facilities that offer the same specialization, but those with similar specializations as well. For instance, yoga studio, fitness studio, pool, and gym are all competing with each other in one way or another. Therefore, distance to the nearest competitors along with the rating will play a significant role in choosing an optimal location for the gym.
* **Adjacent Tenants** - Two sides of the same coin: facilities that promote the gym and facilities that demote it. For instance, located next to a bar, liquor or smoke store, or fast-food venue does not deliver a "be healthy" message, while having such neighbors as organic grocery or sporting gear stores can help to maintain a client base.
